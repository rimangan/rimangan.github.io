			<h2 style="color:darkgreen">Searching for the genetic correlates of
			human-specific phenotypes and disease</h2>
			<p>
				In the last six million years, humans and dramatically diverged from our
				recent great ape ancestors to acquire remarkable new phenotypes, 
				including bipedal locomotion and the development of the human brain. New
				advances in genomics and population genetics provide new avenues to
				explore how changes in our genome during that time have caused those
				changes to come about. In my work, here are the <b><i>Main Questions
				</i></b>: What makes us human, and how did we get here? How did rapid
				 changes in our genome change our susceptibility to diseases?
