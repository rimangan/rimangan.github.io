		<h2 class="subtitle">Searching for the genetic underpinnings of
			human-specific phenotypes and disease</h2>
		<p class="para-text">
			In the last six million years, humans and dramatically diverged from our
			recent great ape ancestors to acquire remarkable new phenotypes, 
			including bipedal locomotion and the development of the human brain. New
			advances in genomics and population genetics provide new avenues to
			explore how changes in our genome during that time have caused those
			changes to come about. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are the <b><i>Main Questions
			</i></b>: What makes us human, and how did we get here? How did rapid
			 changes in our genome change our susceptibility to diseases?

			Riley Mangan was born in 1993 in Libertyville, Illinois. After graduating
			from Prospect High School in the suburbs of Chicago, he attended Davidson
			College in Davidson, North Carolina. As an undergraduatee, he conducted
			research in the lab of Dr. Rachid El Bejjani to study the molecular 
			mechanisms by which deletion of the gene <i>rab-6.2</i> in <i>C. elegans</i>
			induced a deficiency in epidermis integrity. In the summers, he also 
			worked in the lab of Dr. Paul Grippo, first at Northwestern University, and 
			later when his lab moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago. In the Grippo
			lab, Riley investigated the contribution of TGF-Î² signaling to tumor progression
			in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. During these years, Riley developed a
			passionate interest in research science.

		<p>	
			After graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in Biology in 2016, Riley began 
			his professional career as a research
			technician in the lab of Dr. Sallie R. Permar at the Duke Human Vaccine 
			Institute. There he studied a variety of topics related to the development
			of vaccines to prevent pediatric viral infections, specifically for HIV and CMV.
			In this position, Riley authored a study on the molecular mechanisms by which
			the extracellular matrix protein Tenascin-C blocks the ability of HIV to enter
			target cells.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2018, Riley matriculated in the Ph.D. program in Cell and Molecular Biology at
			Duke University and joined the lab of Dr. Craig B. Lowe in the department of 
			Molecular Genetics and Microbiology. In this lab, Riley sought
			to understand the genetic architecture of human evolutionary change and disease.
			He earned his doctorate in 2023.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2023, Riley joined the Computation Biology Group in the Computer Science and 
			Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
			Under the mentorship of Dr. Manolis Kellis, Riley uses deep learning models to 
			interpret how genetic changes that have accumulated on the human lineage have 
			impacted human-specific transcriptional and epigenomic phenotypes.
